<h2>About Me — Farid Aliyev</h2>
<p>
  I am an 18-year-old Computer Science student at ADA University with a strong interest in technology and problem-solving. From an early age, spending time on computers helped me discover my desire to work in the field of computer science and understand how digital systems function. This early curiosity gradually developed into a clear academic and career goal.
